    "**Background**: Fraud is a type of financial crime risk that poses threats to customers and banks. There're multiple typologies within fraud such as authorised and unauthorised digital, payment, credit card, application, scams, and lending fraud, etc. Financial institutions deploy data science capabilities in banking data to analyse fraud patterns, detect, and mitigate fraud risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Fraud, Bank Account Opening**: refers to the deliberate submission of false, forged, or stolen information during the account opening process with the intent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain financial products/services under false pretenses\n",
    "- Facilitate money laundering or other financial crimes\n",
    "- Circumvent regulatory controls and due diligence requirements\n",
    "- Create vehicles for future illicit activities\n",
    "\n",
    "(Reference: Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: This solution aims to discern patterns and detect application fraud in the form of bank account opening by applying statistical analysis, data visualisation, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression and XGBoost) to analyse and model bank account data. This covers the entire (iterative) life cycle from exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, modelling to model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**: Financial institutions face the following challenges in fraud detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *False positive*: Genuine customers/transactions flagged as fraudulent leading to increased investigation expenses.\n",
    "- *False negative*: Failure to detect fraudulent customers/transactions leading to financial loss and reputational damage, sometimes regulatory fines.\n",
    "- *Class imblance*: Fraud data is typically imbalanced which requires processing before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodologies**: Model governance prioritises explainability in the financial industry. Logistic regression and XGBoost models are used in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Logistic Regression* is a surpervised learning method that is highly transparent. This dataset has a binary response variable `fraud_bool` with large quantities of numerical and categorical variables available for feature engineering. Logistic regression is an appropriate method for predicting fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *XGBoost*: A supervised, ensemble tree-based machine learning technique useful for anomaly detection.\n"
